# Example of an iterative loop
# the i variable can be confusing and can be changed to a named variable
# all_tweets = [
#     "tweet one",
#     "tweet two",
#     "tweet three",
#     "tweet four",
#     "tweet five",
# ]

# total_tweets = all_tweets.size
# i = 0

# while (i <= total_tweets)
#     puts all_tweets[i]
#     i += 1
# end

# Here is an infinite love loop

# positive_infinity=+1.0/0.0 
# this is how you express infinity in Ruby but it is a float not an interger

unconditional_love=3
i=1
while (i < unconditional_love)
    puts "I still love you"
end
